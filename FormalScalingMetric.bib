The book also contains what I think is a nice review of some of the basic theory of parallel computing including Amdahl's law, Gustafson-Barsis's law, the Karp-Flatt metric, and the Isoefficiency metric.},

@article{Faber1986,
	Annote = {Paper demonstrating that in theory no parallel algorithm can have better than linear performance. The short (and in retrospect obvious) proof is that if a parallel algorithm has a speedup greater than p (the number of processing elements), then you could make a serial algorithm that ran the instructions for each of the p processing elements in sequence, and that would take p times the time of the serial algorithm, which would result in a speedup of p.

Of course, in practice it is possible to get superlinear speedup if the problem fits better in smaller parallel units.
